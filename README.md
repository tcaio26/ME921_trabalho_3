Implementation and interpretation of a Weighted Stochastic Block Model (WSBM) model on A Song Of Ice And Fire interaction data, to find groups in characters of the franchise. Originally meant for a university project.

Data available on https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/

"code" contains the code used for model ajustment and image generation. Code the final model might not be present due to file loss, but all created functions are available and working.

"data" contains the adjacency matrix, as it takes a few minutes to generate.

"final model" contains alpha, beta and pi matrices for the final model, as well as characters with cluster labels.

"images" contains images generated.

"ME921_atividade_3.pdf" is the university project delivered, in portuguese. "WSBM_in_ASOIAF__english.pdf" is the adapted english translation.
